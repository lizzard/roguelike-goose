The dragon stands up, shaking the floor with its vast bulk.
It says, "Yeah, OK, I have to hand it to you. Follow me."
The dragon mutters a spell. You are sucked into a magical portal!

Vault of Vastness
Soaring arches overhead, stone display cases and cubbyholes in the walls. The treasure hall of a dragon, emptied of its loot.

You can see a rainbow dragon, a gelatinous cube, a wispy ghost, a cave snake, a soot sprite, an iridium bat, a spider and a confused adventurer here.

You swoon.
The world shimmers and whirls.
You wake up nestled into a hollow of warm sand.
You feel completely healed after your nap.

Shorehaven
A peaceful, secluded little beach, just the right size for a dungeon-going goose. A good place to tuck your head under your wing for a short nap. Or you can swim out into the lake.

Dear Gnarf, 
   How's things back at the village? I'm not doing so good. I took the AirDnD gig. Only place in the realm that would take me with no references. Avoid if if you can. They WATCH you, all the time, we can't tell how, so you can't even take a little nap on a slow day. Every once in a while, you get a creepy voice out of nowhere telling you to move to some different location in the dungeon. 
   And this dungeon, I swear to Sfigplatz, it's cold, it's dirty, it's wet, there's nowhere to pee and no break room, we just stand around all day. It's impossible to get around, sometimes we can't even leave, because whenever they move us to a new cavern, all the rooms seem to have been changed around! Anyway, I hear a noise, someone coming, must.... ARRRRRRGH!!!

 The letter ends here, as a splotch of greenish ichor seems to have burned the parchment away.
