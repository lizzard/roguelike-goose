The dragon stands up, shaking the floor with its vast bulk.
It says, "Yeah, OK, I have to hand it to you. Follow me."
The dragon mutters a spell. You are sucked into a magical portal!

Vault of Vastness
Soaring arches overhead, stone display cases and cubbyholes in the walls. The treasure hall of a dragon, emptied of its loot.

You can see a rainbow dragon, a gelatinous cube, a wispy ghost, a cave snake, a soot sprite, an iridium bat, a spider and a confused adventurer here.

The water feels great!
Ominous, like a grim battleship, you glide across the crystal waters.

Cavern of the Lake of Tears
A still, deep lake stretches into the distance. It's vast. You can't see the other side.

~~~~ next direction will be down

Exits: up (Hall of Time) or down (Rockslide Cavern)

You get out of the water.

Rockslide Cavern
Boulders have tumbled down on one side of this cave. It's a tight squeeze to get by them.

You can see a confused adventurer here.

Exits: east (Evil Archives) or up (Cavern of the Lake of Tears)

You can't see the sky anymore!
There is no way out.

Dungeon Entrance
Stone walls, mildewed with glowing stuff, widen into a large bare room.

You can see a wispy ghost, a diamond tiara and a giant rat here.

Exits: west (Evil Archives)
